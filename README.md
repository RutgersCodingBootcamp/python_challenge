This Repo consists of two main folders, PyBank and PyPoll. inside each of these folders, there's a python script and a "Resourses" folder and an "Aalysis" folder. the description of each python script is given below:


## PyBank

  * this Script will take a csv file with two columns, "Date" and "Profit/Loss" and analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
  

then these results are shown in the Terminal, and a text file will be created with the results (in the analysis folder).

## PyPoll

  * this script will take a csv file that is composed ofthree columns, "Voter Id", "County" and "Candidate" and goes through the data to calculate the following:


  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
  
  

then these results are shown in the Terminal, and a text file will be created with the results (in the analysis folder).
